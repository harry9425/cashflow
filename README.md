Our app also has various algorithms for sorting expenses according to different data types entered. This means you can easily filter your expenses by category, date, or other factors, making it easy to see where your money is going and identify areas where you can cut back. You can also set a budget for a particular category and the app will notify you when you are approaching the budget limit.
We have developed Cash Flow using Java for android and it is optimized for smooth performance and easy navigation. The app is compatible with all the latest versions of Android, and it is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
